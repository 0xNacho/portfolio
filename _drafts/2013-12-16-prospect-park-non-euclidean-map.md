A non-euclidean “map” of Prospect Park, Brooklyn. Created using a GoPro camera mounted to my head, iMovie for video editing and Open-Frameworks for combining the video shots into one screen space. Inspired by the theory of artist and cartographer Dennis Wood and work by Annette Kim, Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Planning at <a href="http://slab.scripts.mit.edu/wp/maps/narrative-maps/">MIT's SLAB</a>

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>  - Go-Pro  - OpenFrameworks
