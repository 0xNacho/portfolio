Chris Henrick currently works at [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com/about/who/) as a Design Technologist in San Francisco, California. He is an alumni of the [Parsons MFA Design and Technology program](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/) at the New School in New York City. His thesis at MFA DT was a web app he conceptualized and coded called [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) that seeks to solve the problem of NYC landlords lying to tenants about [rent-stabilization](http://www.nycrgb.org/html/resources/faq/rentstab.html#exactly) and illegally deregulating rent-stabilized apartments. You can learn more about it in an [article he wrote for Urban Omnibus](http://urbanomnibus.net/2015/05/using-open-data-to-strengthen-tenants-rights-activism/).

Chris has consulted in web development for groups such as [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com/), [Pratt's Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative](https://www.pratt.edu/pratt-research-and-centers/spatial-analysis-visualization-initiative/), and [Radish Lab](http://radishlab.com/). Prior to attending Parsons Chris worked as a Cartographer and GIS specialist at [Avalon Travel Publishing](http://avalontravelbooks.com/) in Berkeley, CA. He originally got his start in "geo" as a GIS / Cartographer intern at [GreenInfo Network](http://www.greeninfo.org/) in San Francisco, CA in 2010. His undergraduate degree is in Geography and Urban Studies, from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA.

In his spare time Chris helps organize and facilitate [Maptime](http://maptime.io/), a volunteer group dedicated to educating non-experts about GIS, cartography, and interactive web-mapping; free of charge.
