![the MPG Ranch Habitat Restoration Map app]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-habitat-01-overview.jpg)

The MPG Ranch Habitat Restoration Map enables a team of environmental scientists to effectively
communicate ongoing management plans and actions with their stakeholders and provides
a venue for discussion of restoration research and practices through an interactive
web map application.

I created this web app while working at [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com) using modern web technology
including React, Redux, Leaflet, CARTO, Heroku, and AWS and other tools. The web map
is not yet live, though I wanted to be sure to document my work on it in the meantime.
As such I'm including some screen captures here alongside notes of how it was built.

## About MPG Ranch:

> Set in the heart of Montanaâ€™s Bitterroot Valley, MPG Ranch lies on over
14,000 acres of rich undeveloped landscape. Established in 2009
and privately owned, MPG strives to preserve the natural
communities that make this area beautiful and focuses on research
to restore and protect native diversity.

This web app involved solving a multitude of technical problems, including integrating:

- a Shapefile of 60+ management unit polygons with environmental attribute data
- High resolution (10cm) aerial imagery of the ranch
- Raster GIS data representing [NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index)
and [solar insolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance)
- Qualitative data on activities, management, plans, and research
- Professional photography of the ranch and activities
- Report slide decks that document research and restoration work on the ranch

To solve these development challenges a modern web stack was used that included
the following front-end libraries and tooling:

- **React** for building out UI components
- **Redux** for managing application state
- **Leaflet** for displaying geographic data and handling map interactions
- **EMCAScript 2015 (ES6)** for leveraging the latest features in Javascript
- **Gulp, Browserify,** and **Babel** as a front-end build system
- **Marked** for handling the conversion and sanitization of markdown text into HTML

and the following "backend" web services:

- **Google Forms** for allowing the client to enter qualitative data by management unit
- **[CARTO](https://carto.com)** for syncing tables generated from Google Forms
and for hosting vector geospatial data
- **CARTO's [SQL API](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/sql-api)** for
fetching data to load into the application
- The **[AWS Lambda Tiler](https://hi.stamen.com/stamen-aws-lambda-tiler-blog-post-76fc1138a145#.n8xuphpze)**
for serving tiles generated from aerial imagery and raster data

## Habitat Restoration Map Features

The map allows a user to view various information about the ranch as a whole as
well as individual "management units." Users may click on a management unit polygon
to bring up a detail pane which displays that unit's photo carousel, environmental data,
management activities, recent activities or "actions," and report slide decks.

#### Alternatively, a user may search for a management unit by typing in a text input field and browsing results in a list.

#### Photo carousels may be opened in a lightbox mode to be viewed at a larger size.

#### Various map layers may be toggled as well, including high resolution satellite imagery (for 2015 and 2016 so far), NDVI, solar radiation, and terrain.

#### Clicking on a list item in the Recent Actions pane will zoom the map to the polygon and open the detail pane for that action item's corresponding management unit.

## Slide Builder App
In addition to the Habitat Restoration Map, I built a fully separate web app, the
"Slide Builder App." This web app allows for MPG's habitat restoration team to streamline
the creation of research and progress reports, without using desktop software such as
MS Powerpoint. The habitat restoration team found that this new approach saved them a
great deal of time and frustration when creating reports, a task they previously had dreaded!

![slide builder app]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-slide-builder-overview.jpg)

The Slide Builder web app was built using:

- React & Redux
- React Bootstrap
- Marked
- Heroku
- Node JS
- Express
- CARTO SQL API

Reports are generated through a simple interface; a form on the left lets the user select
a slide layout type (title, portrait, landscape, or text only) while a preview of the slide is displayed
on the right. The user may navigate through the slide deck as slides are created and edit
or remove slides as desired. Previously created slide decks may be loaded, edited, or deleted.

*Publishing a report slide deck*

![slide builder app - publishing success!]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-slide-builder06.jpg)
*Notifying the user that the deck was successfully published*

#### When saved, the reports are stored as JSON data in CARTO. From there the data can be loaded into the Habitat Restoration Map web app.

As the Slide Builder app POSTs data to MPG's CARTO account, a Node JS Express
proxy server keeps MPG's CARTO API Key secure. After a report has been created
and marked as "published", the report data will be fetched by the Habitat
Restoration Map web app. When the user clicks a link for a report, the report data
is rendered as a slide deck and displayed within a lightbox:

![habitat map displaying a report slide deck 1]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-habitat09.jpg)

![habitat map displaying a report slide deck 3]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-habitat11.jpg)

![habitat map displaying a report slide deck 4]({{site.urlimg}}mpg-habitat12.jpg)

## React Slides Component

In order to integrate and maintain consistency with the slides for the two
separate web applications, I created a slides component in React which consumes
JSON data for a report and renders a slide show from that data. Using
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and Github, the slides component can be
installed as a private module in both applications, as well as developed locally
separate from either application for debugging and developing purposes.

## Conclusion

Overall, this was a challenging project due to its many requirements and moving parts.
Working closely with [Nicolette Hayes](http://stamen.com/about/who/nicolette-hayes/),
a talented UI/UX designer at Stamen Design, made it possible to rapidly prototype
various parts of and iterate on the applications. The client, the habitat restoration
team at MPG Ranch, ended up being very pleased with both the Habitat Restoration Map and
Slide Builder app. Both apps are still under development and continue to serve the
restoration team, enabling them to share their work with the general public, colleagues, and ranch owner.
This app could very well serve as a prototype for a platform that allows rural land owners
and/or environmental restoration advocates to coordinate and share their work and research.
